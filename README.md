# ios-foodie

## Quick Start

1. Download and install the latest version of Xcode here:  https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
2. Install Cocoapods (dependency manager https://cocoapods.org/) by running:
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
3. Clone this repo, `cd` into the directory with `Podfile`, and run
```
pod install
```
4. You can now dive into the project by opening up `foodie.xcworkspace` (not `foodie.xcodeproj`)

## Style Guide

We follow SwiftLint, which can be found here: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint
It is packaged as a pod in Xcode, which will run for every local build.

You should also install it in your CLI with
```
brew install swiftlint
```
and run
```
swiftlint autocorrect
```
before committing.
